# Task 2: Scripting to Generate the Report from CSV Files
# Here's an example Python script that reads data from CSV files and generates the same report:


import csv

def generate_report():
    departments = {}
    
    with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(reader)  # Skip header row
        for row in reader:
            department = row[0]
            salary = float(row[1])
            if department in departments:
                departments[department].append(salary)
            else:
                departments[department] = [salary]
    
    report = []
    for department, salaries in departments.items():
        avg_salary = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)
        report.append((department, avg_salary))
    
    report.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Print top 3 departments
    for department, avg_salary in report[:3]:
        print(department)
        print(avg_salary)
        print()

# Assuming you have a CSV file named "data.csv" with two columns: "DEPT_NAME" and "MONTHLY_SALARY" containing the department names and monthly salaries respectively.
